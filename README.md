# Google Data Analytics: Bellabeat Capstone

## Project Overview
As part of the Google Analysis course, I was tasked with answering business questions posed by Urška Sršen, co-founder of the company. Further information found in the project, but this analyses users' activity, sleep and other health data from Fitbit data to use for BellaBeat smart devices. The goal was to explore trends in these datasets and to make recommendations to increase user engagement.

## Note
This project is a demonstration of my first end-to-end data analysis project following the six-step process
This follows the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. This document just does not have them written in this terminology, as it helps others who are not familiar with this to follow along.
