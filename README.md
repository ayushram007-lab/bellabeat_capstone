# Google Data Analytics: Bellabeat Capstone

## Project Overview
As part of the Google Analysis course, I was tasked with answering business questions posed by Urška Sršen, co-founder of the company. Further information found in the project, but this analyses users' activity, sleep and other health data from Fitbit data to use for BellaBeat smart devices. The goal was to explore trends in these datasets and to make recommendations to increase user engagement.

## Task Reference:

## Tools:
The programs I used included Google Sheets for data cleaning and RStudio for data cleaning and data analysis. 

## Data Set:
View public dataset where data was sourced from [Kaggle FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

## Posts
View my [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayushram24/bellabeat-google-data-analytics-capstone) - An interactive notebook version of the analysis.

Attached are the `.Rmd` and `.pdf` files attached to the GitHub repository that are included for offline viewing.

## Note
This project is a demonstration of my first end-to-end data analysis project following the six-step process

This follows the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. This document just does not have them written in this terminology, as it helps others who are not familiar with this to follow along.

In [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayushram24/bellabeat-google-data-analytics-capstone), the dataset is loaded from the kaggle input folder: Activity <- read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbase-data-cleaned/Fitabase_Data_cleaned/dailyActivity_merged_cleaned.csv")

In the  `.Rmd` and `.pdf` files included in the repository, the dataset is loaded from local files:
Activity <- read.csv("Fitabase_Data_cleaned/dailyActivity_merged_cleaned.csv")

To access local files, please find them in the [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayushram24/bellabeat-google-data-analytics-capstone)
