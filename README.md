## Task Reference:
https://bellabeat.com/ 

As part of the Google Analysis course, I was tasked with answering business questions posed by Urška Sršen, co-founder of the company.

## Tools:
The programs I used included Google Sheets for data cleaning and RStudio for data cleaning and data analysis. 

## Data Set:
View public dataset where data was sourced from [Kaggle FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

## Posts
View my [Kaggle Case Study](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayushram24/bellabeat-google-data-analytics-capstone)
Attached are the `.RMD` and `.pdf` files attached to the GitHub repository.

## Note
This is my first attempt at an Analysis project.
This follows the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. This document just does not have them written in this terminology, as it helps others who are not familiar with this to follow along.
